          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>As a student of Interactive Arts and Technology (IAT) at Simon Fraser University, I have cultivated a strong foundation in digital art, focusing on illustration and brand design. A deep passion for visual storytelling drives my creative pursuits and extends into animation and motion design. I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate on logo design, branding, and rebranding projects that pushed me to think strategically and creatively meeting real-world demands. In parallel with client work, I’ve sought out opportunities to grow my craft through specialized courses and self-directed projects. This commitment to continuous learning has allowed me to experiment with new techniques, refine my artistic voice, and stay current with evolving industry trends. Whether illustrating detailed character designs or developing brand systems from the ground up, I bring technical proficiency and a strong conceptual approach to every project I take on.</p>
